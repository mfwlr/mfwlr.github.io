I'm Max Fowler, a computer science educator and researcher.

My primary research focus is on how best to conduct large-scale, fair assessments and support instructors in producing and grading the items necessary for such assessments. Additionally, I am moving more in the direction of broadening participation in computing, in particular looking at the impact of department policies on student demographics.

My teaching background runs a gamut of the curriculum. I have taught multiple introductory programming classes in Java, C, C++, and Python. I have also taught upper division courses in human-computer interaction, data analytics, and learning programming for teaching computer science.

I am currently finishing a PhD at the [University of Illinois](https://cs.illinois.edu/). Prior to pursuing my PhD, I was a Continuing Lecturer at [Purdue University Fort Wayne](https://www.pfw.edu/etcs/computer-science).

This website will be updated to be more fully featured over time. In the meantime, my current CV is available [here](files/Fowler_CV_23.pdf).
